      "detailed_description": "Description\nOur skin goes through a turn-over process of repeating cell regeneration and exfoliation every 28 days. During this process, if the dead skin cells on the skin’s surface clog the pores, inflammation may occur in the pores causing a darkening of the skin tone by preventing new cell regeneration.We created a light and mild toner that can wipe away dead skin cells and sebum in the pores and on the surface of the skin that can remain after cleansing.The main ingredient is plum, which has been used as an herbal medicine for a long time. As a cosmetic ingredient, plum helps to remove dead skin cells and care for skin texture. It creates wonderful synergy with mung bean extract, a skin soothing ingredient, and the chemical exfoliants AHA and BHA.Daily Exfoliating TonerGreen Plum Toner is ideal for use in the morning and evening during the first step of skin care to wipe away residual waste and smooth out the skin texture. After sufficiently moistening a cotton pad with toner, gently wipe the skin from the inside to the outside. It not only cleans up waste but also enhances the skin condition to facilitate better absorption of follow-up skin care products.Green plum water 25% + Mung bean extract 2%Donguibogam, an herbal medicine book from the Joseon Dynasty, states that plums lower the temperature, ease the mind, and help stop thirst and diarrhea. In Korean history, plum and mung bean were used as medicines to treat stomachaches or rid the body of toxins.Plum water and mung bean extract as skin care ingredients help to smooth out skin texture and provide moisture.AHA + BHAWith a mixture of 2% glycolic acid and 0.5% salicylic acid, you can use it every morning and evening to remove dead skin cells without irritating your skin. It is made with a mild formula that combines a low concentration of chemical exfoliants and plant extracts rather than attempting to create powerful effects via overly high concentrations of AHA and BHA since cosmetics are not categorized as drugs. This is because we believe that it is important to constantly monitor and care for the condition of the skin without causing irritation.",

      "detailed_description": "Description\nThe loss of protein, which provides elasticity to our skin's dermal layer, leads to a decrease in collagen and hyaluronic acid, resulting in wrinkles. We developed an eye serum designed to mitigate these wrinkles, combining ginseng extract and retinal.\nFrom the outset, ginseng was our chosen base ingredient for this serum, as it's backed by multiple studies for its effectiveness in reducing wrinkles, thanks to its abundant saponin content.\nWe were keen on integrating Vitamin A with ginseng, specifically its two cosmetic forms, retinol and retinal. Our primary challenge was to balance ingredient stability while minimizing skin irritation. Hence, we incorporated 2% (active ingredient 0.02%) of liposome-stabilized retinal in our formula, allowing customers to experience retinal's effects firsthand.Ginseng root extract 10%In Donguibogam, a Korean herbal medicine book, ginseng was used as an important oriental medicine and recorded as 'Shincho', meaning herb from the gods. Hwang Jini, known as the most beautiful woman in the Joseon Dynasty, used a ginseng decoction as a bath water.The rich saponin in ginseng helps quickly supply moisture to the skin and maintains it deep inside the skin for a long time to help create healthy skin.Retinal Liposome 2%Retinal is a vitamin A derivative and has long been used throughout skincare history to improve wrinkles.When vitamin A is consumed through food, it undergoes metabolic processes that transform it in the order of retinol -> retinal -> retinoic acid. Retinal, which is converted directly to retinoic acid, works faster and more effectively on the skin than retinol, which must go through the process of becoming retinal.We used a 'retinal liposome' that was stabilized by breaking the retinal into smaller elements and enclosing it in liposomes and then adding ingredients such as natural lipids and oils. In addition, we blend ingredients such as glycerin, niacinamide, and cholesterol together to create a more effective product.",

Enter, Isntree's Hyaluronic Acid Sun Stick. The droplet shaped stick makes it easier get into the areas beside the nose and around the eyes. It glides on smoothly, and with no white cast. Of course, Isntree didn't forget to throw in their favorite 8-layer Hyaluronic Acid to prevent moisture loss throughout the day. Now you can rinse your face at work, after a commute, or after a morning jog without fearing the UV damage to come after.\nThe Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick, enriched with natural extracts, offers effective UV protection. It supplies oily and combination skin types with needed moisture and does not impart a sticky feel. It is enriched with hyaluronic acid that restores the moisture balance which in turn revives the skin. The stick format is easy to use.\nFortified with SPF 50+ PA++++ protection against the sun’s UVA and UVB rays. It ontains natural-derived ingredients that moisturize the skin and creates a soothing effect. Moisture loss prevention thanks to the mixture of 8 types of hyaluronic acids.",

We’ve also added Hyaluronic Acid for enhanced hydration and removed herbal fragrances for a gentler experience.\nFor our US customers, we’ll be shipping the FDA-registered OTC version to ensure compliance with local regulations.\nProduct DetailsOur sunscreen uses reef safe ingredients (only physical active ingredients) that leave minimal to no whitecast, stickiness, or pilling for no stress to our mornings and the environment.A fifth of the world's coral reefs have died since 2015 and we are at risk of losing another 40% in the next 30 years.Sunscreens that contain the active ingredients oxybenzone and octinoxate contribute to mass bleaching of coral reefs, leading to some countries banning the use of these sunscreens to protect the oceanic habitat.As a climate inspired brand, we felt it was necessary to create a sunscreen we can rely on to give us total protection without harming the environment.",
